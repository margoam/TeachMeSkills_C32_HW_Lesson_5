# TeachMeSkills_C32_HW_Lesson_5

Tasks which are implemented:

0. Create a three-dimensional array of integers.
Use loops to iterate through the entire array and increase each element by a specified number.
Let the number by which each element will be increased be provided from the console.

1. Chessboard*
Create a program to color a chessboard using a loop.
Create a two-dimensional array of Strings, size 8x8.
Using loops, assign the elements the values of B (Black) or W (White).
The program output should look like this:
W B W B W B W B  
B W B W B W B W  
W B W B W B W B  
B W B W B W B W  
W B W B W B W B  
B W B W B W B W  
W B W B W B W B  
B W B W B W B W

2. Matrix Multiplication*
Create two arrays of integers (two matrices).
Write a program to multiply these two matrices.
First array: {{1,0,0,0},{0,1,0,0},{0,0,0,0}}
Second array: {{1,2,3},{1,1,1},{0,0,0},{2,1,0}}
Expected result:
1 2 3  
1 1 1  
0 0 0

3. Create a two-dimensional array of integers.
Print the sum of all elements of the array to the console.
